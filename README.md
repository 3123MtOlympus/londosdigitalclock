# Londo's Digital Clock

This project features a simple digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The digital clock displays the current time and updates in real-time.

## Getting Started

To view the digital clock, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Prerequisites

There are no specific prerequisites for this project. You only need a web browser to view the digital clock.

## Built With

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page is created using HTML.
- **CSS:** The styling of the digital clock is defined in the `style.css` file.
- **JavaScript:** The dynamic behavior of the digital clock is implemented using JavaScript in the `script.js` file.
- **Google Fonts:** The project uses the Josefin Sans and Teko fonts from Google Fonts for typography.

## How It Works

1. The `index.html` file defines the structure of the web page, including the container for displaying the digital clock.
2. The `style.css` file provides the styles for the digital clock, including font styles, colors, and layout.
3. The `script.js` file contains JavaScript code to update the digital clock with the current time. It uses the `setInterval` function to update the clock every second.
